                    The purpose of the app is to provide a resource for community-minded individuals
                    to locate and/or advertise volunteer opportunities. Many people want to give back
                    to their community (or are part of a group that requires community service)
                    but aren't aware of all the opprtunities that are around them.
                    <br><br>
                    You can browse the opportunities already entered on the site and add the event
                    to your account page if you want to participate in that volunteer opportunity.
                    If you want to organize an opportunity that doesn't already exist, you can 
                    create the event for other users to see and select. If you find an 
                    organization whose events really speak to you, you can click a link 
                    that redirects you to their website for more information.

                    Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board
                    with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Players alternate turns per move.
                    A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consits of moving a piece 
                    to an unoccupied square or one that is occupied by an opponent's piece, which 
                    is captured and removed from the game. Each piece has it's own moveset.

                    Checkers is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. 
                    One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces.
                    <br><br>
                    Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. 
                    A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied 
                    square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the 
                    square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured 
                    (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.

                    The app allows a user to document vacations that they have experienced 
                    where they and other users can view.
                    <br><br>
                    You can browse a list of vacations that other users have documented 
                    and view them. The user will be able to create a vacation module where
                    they will give it a name and they will be able to type paragraphs describing
                    their trip. Once a vacation module is created the user will be able to add
                    destinations to that vacation module.
